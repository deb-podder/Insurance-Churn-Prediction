Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives Insurance companies an opportunity to come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening. Given are 16 distinguishing factors that can help in understanding the customer churn, your objective as a data scientist is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether the insurance company will lose a customer or not using these factors.
